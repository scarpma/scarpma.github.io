      <h3>This page is about me, so I guess I should say something.</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Martino</strong> is a <em>very handsome</em> guy, with incredible skills. His favorite movies are the following:
        <ul>
          <li>Castaway</li>
          <li>A star is born</li>
          <li>Dallas' buyers club</li>
        </ul>
        but if we want to be more precise, here the ordering:
        <ol>
          <li>Castaway</li>
          <li>A star is born</li>
          <li>Dallas' buyers club</li>
        </ol>
        Another interesting thing about me is that I really love dogs. This is a picture of a dog <img src="images/dog.jpg" alt="A very beautiful dog.">
